I do not have coronavirus, I am sick of how this is potentially ruining my life plans.
</p>
<p>
I am supposed to apply for a PhD but I need some documents from my University.
But guess what!
My Uni is not working anymore and in the days before the crisis, basically they made me go to different offices to look for the damned document I need, and of course each office sent me to talk to another person and so.
</p>
<p>
Now I am stuck because I need some document to apply for the PhD and pass my admission process only then I can apply for funding in MÃ©xico.
</p>
<p>
So, who could even imagine that some hideous sanitary oversights would change the life plans of the whole fucking world?
I hate this.
I really hate this.
</p>
<p>
REEEEEEE!!!!!

This is the first blog post on my page, currently my blog is really primitive, I think. I do not want anything fancy, though.
</p>

<p>
The main reason I made my website from scratch (almost, I steal the css from
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke's</a>
) is that I have been using a Jekyll theme and is not what I am looking for.
Also I had it hosted on Github pages and although I do not have any real complaints about Github, I wanted to use Gitlab pages.
</p>

<p>
Also I am using my brand new domain, I feel cool.
I bought it from
<a href="https://www.epik.com/">Epik</a>.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and the icons are from
<a href="https://feathericons.com/">here</a>,
they are really nice and open source.
</p>

<p>
I pretend to talk about mathematics, linux stuff, and maybe some occasional rants and things about my life, since I am not using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram lately. 
So that a blog would be nice to vent my shit.
</p>

<p>
I have just started using the <i>lb</i>	blog system by Luke Smith.
And yes, I know I talk about Luke a lot, but he make good stuff, fuck off.
Anyway, if someone is interested in take a look at it
<a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb" target="_blank">here</a>
is the thing.
Is not really difficult to use, but of cours if you are not aware of your own directory tree, the things will get ugly.
This entry is an update from the original one using <i>lb</i>.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for reading or whatever.
