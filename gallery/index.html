<h1>Gallería</h1>

<p>
Since I categorically refuse to give out my personal information to Facebook, I decided to make a picture gallery where I can share some pictures.
</p>

<p>
Am I reinventing the wheel?
Well...maybe. 
Why do you care?
</p>

<h2>Albums</h2>
<p>
I compiled the pictures in different albums, everything is organised by date and all that.
</p>

<h3 id="life">

	Where I [have] live[d]
	</a>
</h3>
<p>
Here you can see pictures of places I have lived or live in.
This is because, in the same city you live you can find beautiful things, but I cannot put them in the traveling gallery.

This are pictures of different mathematics congresses, conferences, workshops, schools, etc that I attended.
