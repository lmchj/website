<h1>A new dynamic</h1>


<p>
I have decided to start storing my music locally again, as a caveman.
</p>

<p>
This is because of my current concerns about digital footprint, and to avoid all propietary software possible.
</p>

<p>
Also the fact that I feel like from a long time ago I have not really listened to music, I mean, usually I have the music in the background and I am not processign what I am listening to, and that is really awful.
</p>

<p>
So that I am storing my music and getting it by album to listen and enjoy everything
And to keep doing it I will be posting weekly a blog entry about an album that I really liked in that week.
</p>

<p>
Currently I am still listening to something that is really making me happy, so that late on this week I will made a blog entry with the recommendation.
