I do not have coronavirus, I am sick of how this is potentially ruining my life plans.
</p>
<p>
I am supposed to apply for a PhD but I need some documents from my University.
But guess what!
My Uni is not working anymore and in the days before the crisis, basically they made me go to different offices to look for the damned document I need, and of course each office sent me to talk to another person and so.
</p>
<p>
Now I am stuck because I need some document to apply for the PhD and pass my admission process only then I can apply for funding in MÃ©xico.
</p>
<p>
So, who could even imagine that some hideous sanitary oversights would change the life plans of the whole fucking world?
I hate this.
I really hate this.
</p>
<p>
REEEEEEE!!!!!
