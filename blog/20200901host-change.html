<h1>Host change</h1>


<p>
I will change my host next weekend.
I have had this website as a Gitlab page, but I have wanted to try a VPS from the beggining and finally have decided to do it.
I'll probably use Vultr.
</p>

<p>
Also I hope to make changes to the css and to fill some of the place holders.
It is very likely that I will embed photos from
<a href="https://myalbum.com" target="_blank">My Album</a>
for the case of the page for
<a href="pages/gardening" target="_blank">gardening.</a>
</p>

<p>
The page of books have suffered modifications and my spotify playlists are no longer there, I will just recommend music.
