<h1>On the new pages</h1>

<p>
Hey, I have some new pages for my website and some clarification for the old ones.
</p>

<p>
First of all, II have ditched my Spotify premium account, so that I am not using it anymore.
The
<a href="../pages/spotify.html" target="_blank">Spotify Playlists page</a>
will be deprecated soon, or will have musical recomendations as themselves.
</p>

<p>
Second, I added some section for academic content.
I will place
<a href="../pages/class-notes.html" target="_blank">Class Notes</a>
there.
The class notes will be in Spanish, and later in English.
</p>

<p>
Finally I decided to put pictures and content of my garden, farming and reforestation here.
So that you can visit
<a href="../pages/gardening.html" target="_blank">Gardening</a>
for it.
I want to build a blog dedicated only to that, but later.
</p>

<p>
I want to make a more minimalistic site, so that I need to play with css soon.
You will se changes.
</p>

<p>
And that's it, hope you like it.
</p>
