<h1>On the update of the book recommendations page</h1>

<p>
Yesterday I gave myself some time to write the first part of the book recommendations page, talking a little about some books to delight ourselves during our favorite pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Actually I am currently reading both <i>Ghost of Chance</i> and <i>A Journal of the Plague Year</i>, pretty nice so far.
The Plague is in the waiting list.
</p>
<p>
So...wash your hands and read. You can take a look at that page
<a href="../pages/books.html">here</a>.
