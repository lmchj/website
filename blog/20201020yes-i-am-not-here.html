Sorry, I have been very busy lately.
</p>

<p>
But I am about to actually make the thing where I recommend music weekly and to use the blog regularly.
</p>

<p>
I actually deleted my Twitter and Instagram accounts.
It feels nice, I will not miss it.
</p>

<p>
Now I need to be productive again.
I already finished the process for student visa to go to the UK and I feel free.
There are some interesting things to do before I go away, but it can wait.
However something that cannot wait is reading, I need to discuss some things with my future PhD supervisor and haven't read anything.
</p>

<p>
Maybe soon I will update
<a href="books.html">the books page</a>
because I have some books to read and I am looking forward to it.
I want to make a library page with a proper classification system, as I said before, but I think I need to do it on my personal library before that on my website.
</p>

<p>
I have not completed the class notes I was preparing.
My god, I hate myself, I don't do anything.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, soon I will be active here.
