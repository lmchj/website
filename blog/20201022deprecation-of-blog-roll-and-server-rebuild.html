<p>
I will stop using the
<a href="../2020.html">rolling version of the blog</a>
I find it useless, confusing, and messy.
So that I will deprecate it this weekend, for that I need to update my blog management script and remove the links that go to it on the website.
Is not the hell of a task, but it is a change.
</p>

<p>
I am using
<a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb" target="_blank">this thing</a>
for my blog's management, and have been using it kind of blindly, but there are some stuff I don't like.
For instance the use of <code>sed</code> is weird and cause a weird problem, I can look at what Luke does, but I rather dismember the script myself.
My boy Luke make weird things I don't like sometimes.
</p>

<p>
Also since I failed on my email setup&mdash;and some other stuff&mdash;, my server is kind of a mess in some regard, so that I will rebuild it.
Fortunately is incredibly easy.
I might also finally setup the Cal/CardDav server and try again with the email, but I am not sure of the later.
I think I might as well use
<a href="https://forwardemail.net/en" target="_blank">Forward Email</a>,
they seem reliable, but I don't know, I want my own thing.
