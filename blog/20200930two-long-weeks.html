<h1>Two long weeks</h1>
<p>
I have commited to myself to blog each week, but since September 18th everything got really crazy.
I got a scholarship to start my PhD on University of Leeds, and since then I have been arranging things in order to move to England.
</p>

<p>
Everything is running smoothly, but have been really exhausting, I haven't even had the oportunity to properly accomplish some of my job duties.
Hopefully next week, everything will get a little less stressing.

I kind of starting with the gardening page, but it still ugly.
Next weekend I will be moving something there.
