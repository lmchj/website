First of all, ProtonMail is actually better than Gmail, but not for me at the moment.
Maybe is the right service at the wrong time.
</p>

<p>
However, my main problem with ProtonMail is that in order to get basic features, such as IMAP/SMTP you got to pay.
Also they "give" you an account with domain
<code>@pm.me</code>
but you are not allowed to send emails from there, only recieve.
</p>

<p>
Now, the free plan, actually is not that bad (for my use case).
They give you 500 MB of storage, and 150 messager per day.
Which is not a problem for me, since I delete most of my emails once I have the info that I need, and certainlly I will not send more than 150 messages a day.
</p>

<p>
But still, to access some basic features you will have to pay.
For instance, automatic response is a no go without a plan, also if you use the mobile app you cannot set a signature without the
<b>sEnT With prOtonMail SEcUrE eMaIL</b>
thing.
Actually I think it also keeps that tag line in the website, which is awful.
</p>

<p>
There are some other things that are of course paid features everywhere, such as multiple users and custom domains.
But certainlly after, some months of usage it is clear for me that ProtonMail is not my favorite service at the moment.
</p>

<p>
As you might suppose, I started using ProtonMail because of privacy concerns, which I still endorse.
But, currently my privacy paranoia is getting higher and why I should trust ProtonMail more than Google?
(Of course you can trust ProtonMail more than Gmail, at least they are open source now).
And actually I have just discovered that there are several unnoficial desktop apps for *Linux, but as they are unnoficial I do not want to use them.
Certainlly I should check them, but not now.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this is far from promoting the use of Google.
But I cannot deny that they offer nice services.
Actually I use Google Calendar, Contacts myself, and most of time I suggest my family to use Google Photos (even though I decided to stop using it) for them to manage their pictures library.
</p>

<p>
So, long story short, I will use Gmail again as my main email service, until I decide to buy a Raspberry Pi or rent a VPS and I set my servers for calendar, email and contacts.
Now my email is
<a href="mailto:lmchaparroj@gmail.com" target="_blank">lmchaparroj@gmail.com</a>.
I wil set up that thing later but it is already on.
</p>

<p>
I will actually recommend ProtonMail if you are willing to pay $4USD a month to use it properly, </p>
