Yoko Miwa is just a great pianist, and I just met her music a week ago.

<p>
The whole album is just so good, even the covers they make of popular songs.
I particularly dislike tHE bEaTLeS, but I kind of liked the transition between Golden Slumbers and You Never Give Me Your Money.
Needless to say, that was my least favorite piece of the whole album.

The fact that Sunshine Follows the Rain is the most popular song in Spotify is weird for me, since Keep Talkin' (the song) was my favourite one.

All songs are complex but easy to listen and beautiful.
