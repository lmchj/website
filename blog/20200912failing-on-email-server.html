<h1>Failing on email server</h1>

Yesterday on a moment when I was running away from my job, I decided to follow
<a href="ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zP7qooM4pY" target="_blank">Luke's tutorial</a>
to setup an email server on a VPS, but I kind of failed.
</p>

<p>
Actually my attempt was not that bad, since everything ran smoothly and had problems on the rDNS, which associates my domain weirdly.
I think that actually it has to be with the fact that my droplet name on DigitalOcean was wrong, and as I changed it might not just work like that.
</p>

<p>
I will wait a couple of days, because often new IPs get banned from Gmail and Outlook and such big companis that hate people.
So that if on a couple of days my emails to them keep getting rejected or on their spam folder, then on the next weekend I will try to make my email server again.
I want to make a CalDAV and CardDAV server with
<a href="https://radicale.org/3.0.html" target="_blank">radicale</a>,
so that I might do that today, it seems really easy.
</p>

<p>
Also I added this new page about
<a href="../fuera-de-la-caverna.html">my podcast</a>
and also updated the page of
<a href="../podcasts.html">podcasts recommendations</a>.
I hope you like them.
