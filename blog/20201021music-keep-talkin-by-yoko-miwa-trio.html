<p>
This is an album that I have had on my head for a lot of time.
I think I first listened to it on July or something like that.
</p>

<p>
<b>It is just incredible!</b>

Yoko Miwa is an incredibly talented pianist.
She and Connie Han&mdash;whose album Iron Starlett I will review later&mdash;are my favourite jazz pianists right now.
This album feels fresh and soothing but also it is full of energy, I'm just in love with her music. 
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that I hate the pop-jazz shitty covers she make.
I mean she covers The Beatles, what kind of stupid joke is that.
But the songs from herself are just amazing.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Favourite songs:</b> <i>Keep Talkin'</i>, <i>If You Are Blue</i>, <i>Sunshine Follows The Rain</i> and her cover of <i>Booggie Stop Shuffle</i></li>
	<li><b>Less favourite song:</b> <i>Golden Slumbers/You Never Give Me Your Money</i>. I mean, The Beatles? You are way better than this shit.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I am not the <i>critique</i> about anything, I just enjoy things.
Listen to it and let Yoko Miwa hug you.
