<h1>About why I have not posted anything</h1>

<p>
I have not posted anything in a while, the reason is that I am kind of busy.
I have been studying for admission exams for graduate schools and doing some data scrapping abot coronavirus and stuff, besides my job.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to publish an entry ranting about ProtonMail, but it got too long and I want to think things clearly, I am very concerned about online privacy and online footprint lately.
</p>

<p>
Some friends and I are supposed to start recording a podcast on this wednesday.
</p>

<p>
Also I am kind of worried and I am waiting for my school to give me some documents, I will call tomorrow to ask for them.
A lot is going on.
