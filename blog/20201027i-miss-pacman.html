<h1>I miss pacman</h1>
<p>
I already finished my initial setup for Windows.
And I have to say that I am not enjoying it as much as I would enjoy setup any other thing.
As the title says <b>I MISS PACMAN</b>.
</p>

<p>
Actually what I miss is any kind of package manager, I hate going to every single webpage of any application I want to install.
Fortunatelly there exists
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target=_blank>Chocolatey</a>
and so far it is <i>fine</i>.
I used it to install some applications and it works nicely.
I would recommend any Windows user to get familiar with this package manager.
</p>

<p>
Also I installed VirtualBox because on this time I want to try some things.
As I said before, <b>I will use Win10 only for a couple of months</b> and then this computer is going to be my brother's.
Certainly I cannot wait to have my hands on a 2011's Thinkpad.
</p>

<p>
Oh and the things I will try on VB are some operative systems in order to choose one to use for a long time.
I've been thinking of using
<a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/" target=_blank>Alpine</a>
since is GNU free and it would be nice to stop using the <i>GNU interpretation</i> of every single utility.
Also I might try
<a href="https://artixlinux.org/" target=_blank>Artix</a>
with its different init systems in order to choose one of them.
Actually as Alpine uses <i>OpenRC</i> as init system, I might only try Artix on the <i>runit</i> and <i>s6</i> versions.
My safety is of course Arch, but I think being away of <i>systemd</i> might even be beneficial in order to learn some new stuff.
I think I will also try
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/" target=_blank>FreeBSD</a>
and
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/" target=_blank>OpenBSD</a>
because It might be interesting to use the <i>BSD userland</i>.
If you know about any other <i>systemd</i> and </GNU> free distro feel free to
<a href="mailto:lmchaparroj@tutanota.com" target=_blank>email me</a>
</p>

<p>
Now, this will be a busy week on work and I might not blog often.
But on the weekend I am planning on organsing my digital library with Dewey's help and also to install Artix.
Have a nice week and stay home.
