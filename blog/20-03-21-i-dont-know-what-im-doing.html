		I don't know what I am doing, really

	<h2>
		The abstract
	</h2>
	<p>
	This is the first blog post on my page, currently my blog is really primitive, I think. I do not want anything fancy, though.
	</p>
	<p>
	The main reason I made my website from scratch (almost, I steal the css from
	<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke's</a>
	) is that I have been using a Jekyll theme and is not what I am looking for.
	Also I had it hosted on Github pages and although I do not have any real complaints about Github, I wanted to use Gitlab pages.
	</p>
	<p>
	Also I am using my brand new domain, I feel cool.
	I bought it from
	<a href="https://www.epik.com/">Epik</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Oh, and the icons are from
	<a href="https://feathericons.com/">here</a>,
	they are really nice and open source.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		The goal
	</h2>
	<p>
	I pretend to talk about mathematics, linux stuff, and maybe some occasional rants and things about my life, since I am not using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram lately. 
	So that a blog would be nice to vent my shit.
	</p>

	<h2>
		The conclusion
	</h2>
	<p>
		Thanks for reading or whatever.
