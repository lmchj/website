<h1>Fresh website</h1>

<p>
I have already finished the first step on the renewal of my website.
It keeps a monospace font, the nord color scheme, but the landing page is very clean.
Also I added options to donate via Bitcoin and BAT.
</p>

<p>
Pages mostly remain the same, but I want to change some things.
For instance I wanted to add some of the notes on linear algebra that I have been preparing, but since they are not finished so idk.
I did not filled up the gardening page, but is just because I have not decided if I want the photos to be in the page or in som photo hosting service.
</p>

<p>
I am using DigitalOcean to host. I used the cheapest droplet and it seems plenty.
Probably next weekend I will make a CalDav/CarDav server, and in the future an email server (it will be fun).
</p>

<p>
Hope you enjoy my new page as much as I enjoyed building it.
