<h1>I will use Windows now</h1>
<p>
Yes, as you read, I will use Windows now.
This is an incredibly stupid step in my life but also very necessary.
</p>

<p>
The thing is that I built a PC back before the world started to end.
But I am a user of Linux-ish stuff since I started to actually learn about computers&mdash;like 5 years ago&mdash;, and as such <b>I am incredibly stupid to use Windows</b>.
To be honest I do not care about it, I will not use it really, and the reason I am doing this is because I need to leave my brother this computer running smoothly with all the shitty software he needs for school&mdash;because schools in México, even with the economic disparity, prefer usign expensive shitty software instead of open source and free (money) alternatives&mdash; and as I am too stupid to get pirate software running fine, I have to make some experiments.
</p>

<p>
Of course I will be using the WSL to do plenty of stuff, I mean, is the only good thing Microsoft have manage to do.
I will just need to make some adjustments to my <b>wOrKFlOw</b>, but it should not bother me a lot.

<p>
By the way, that will be my weekend.
I will no longer rebuild my server, I already tidied it up.
But I might do my other projects there, I need to extract all the juice possible from my server, so that if you have any good idea, feel free to

I think that's all.
