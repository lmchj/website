<p>
Everything is made up, just choose whatever made up shit most fits for you.
</p>

<p>
I am done with science, philosophy, mathematics, people, literature, techology, social media, and all things I like.
I mean, I am done justifying why I like or dislike things.
Why do you care, sucker?
</p>

<p>
I am not using shit I do not trust or find useful, so:
Bye Facebookish stuff, WhatsApp is stupid and nobody should use it.
I am probably done with social media altogether.
I will live in old school forums, rss feeds and my website for ever.
Internet sucks.
