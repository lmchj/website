<h1>
Gardening
</h1>

<p>

On this page I will place some pictures of my (and my mom's) garden, and some other places where I practice gardening, reforestation and farming.

</p>

<p>

For advice on these issues, refer to my blog or email me at <a href="mailto: lmchaparroj@tutanota.com">lmchaparroj@tutanota.com</a>.
I might build a blog only dedicated to this kind of stuff, but later.

</p>

<h2>
Front garden
</h2>

<h2>
Street garden
</h2>

<p>

I make a difference between this place and the front garden because the front garden is inside the house.

</p>

<h2>
Some farming
</h2>

<p>

We have a small bed where we grow different kind of things, such as potatoes, jalape√±o peppers, onion, tomatoes, acelga (chard), broccoli and that kind of stuff.
