<h1>Podcasts</h1>

<p>
	Here are some podcasts I enjoy.
	I add the website of the podcast and also the rss feed.
</p>

<p>
	The language of the podcast is in the title.
	[En] for english, [Es] for spanish.
</p>

<p>
	If you like The Office, you will really enjoy Angela Kingsley and Jenna Fischer breaking down each and every single episode of the show.
</p>

<p>
	They are two incredibly and lovely people, and have a very strong connection, so that they know how to talk together and that is really amusing.

<p>
	The Partially Examined Life is a show about philosophy for people that do not want to read.
	Or for people that want to read philosophy but don't know what to read now.
</p>

<p>
	The people involved are Mark Linsenmayer, Seth Paskin, Wes Alwan and (most recently) Dylan Casey.
	They basically discuss books and is really interesting and funny.

<p>
	This is actualy the podcast that made go go into podcasts, and I find that interesting since it is a long format podcast, and often this format is not really easy to listen.
</p>

<p>
	But oh my god, Dan Carlin is incredible.
	He made different voices for different characters!
	It is just great.
</p>

<p>
	The escence of this podcast is to tell the stories behind some interesting historic episodes.

<p>
	This is a podcast I made with a couple of friends, Eduardo Limas and Saul Nu√±ez in the voices.
</p>

<p>
	To be honest we only wanted to discuss some topics and also to publish that discussions.
	We have talked about social stuff, philosophy, and some science-ish things.
