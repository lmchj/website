		Books
	</h1>

	<p>
	Here are some books that I would like to recomend, and how to get them online (legally).
	I, of course, endorse piracy in knowledge related things, but I am sure you know how to get pirate books.
	</p>

	<p>
	I have not read all of the books here, some of them are in reading process and some others are in the waiting list.
	Just to be clear.
	</p>

	<p>
	Also, I am not someone who really likes talking about reading, I do not feel comfortable about that. 
	I do not want to be pretentious and neither make people to bring their pretentious colours.
    The only objective of this section is to promote reading, but not to encourage discussion, just excluding some very particular cases and persons.
	</p>

	<p>
	I will try to categorize them in a fuzzy way, for a better understanding about why I recommend them.
	I want to make a library page that would be ordered with a proper classification system, but not know, maybe not ever.
	</p>

	<p>
	All books have two links, one to Wikipedia to get general information about the book, and one to the place you can get it (if any).
	</p>

	<p>
	If you want to share another website where you can get the book, some translation or whatever, feel free to
	<a href="mailto:lmchj@protonmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a>,
	I would add it along the way somehow.
	</p>

	<h2>Coronavirus 2020: Extinction year</h2>
	
	<p>
	This is a category of books to get the best out of our favourite pandemic that is jeopardizing the life plans of the whole world.
	Stay home and read a lot.
