<h1>
Class notes
</h1>

<p>

On this page I will post some of my math classes notes in pdf.

</p>

<p>

Disclaimer: These are not actual math notes that I used to teach.
But mote like an exercise for myself in order to review some contents that I have "learned" on my bachelor degree.
The real reason I am doing this is because I had a really bad class on these topics or I just like them.

</p>


<p>

I hope in the future I will teach these classes and this will save me some of the work.

</p>

<ul>
	<li>Linear algebra.</li>
	<li>Vector calculus.</li>
	<li>Mathematical analysis.</li>
	<li>Complex variables.</li>
	<li>Time series analysis.</li>
	<li>Introduction to probability.</li>
	<li>Linear regression.</li>
	<li>Ordinary differential equations.</li>
	<li>Partial differential equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>

I have not even started writing any of them, this is a placeholder.

</p>

<p>

I will write them on Spanish, then on English.
Some other languages if I actually continue studying them, or someone else decides to help on it.
