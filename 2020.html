<h1>LM's blog</h1>

<p>This is the rolling page for the blog.</p>

<p>I think is a better way to look at it.</p>

This is the first blog post on my page, currently my blog is really primitive, I think. I do not want anything fancy, though.
</p>

<p>
The main reason I made my website from scratch (almost, I steal the css from
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke's</a>
) is that I have been using a Jekyll theme and is not what I am looking for.
Also I had it hosted on Github pages and although I do not have any real complaints about Github, I wanted to use Gitlab pages.
</p>

<p>
Also I am using my brand new domain, I feel cool.
I bought it from
<a href="https://www.epik.com/">Epik</a>.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and the icons are from
<a href="https://feathericons.com/">here</a>,
they are really nice and open source.
</p>

<p>
I pretend to talk about mathematics, linux stuff, and maybe some occasional rants and things about my life, since I am not using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram lately. 
So that a blog would be nice to vent my shit.
</p>

<p>
I have just started using the <i>lb</i>	blog system by Luke Smith.
And yes, I know I talk about Luke a lot, but he make good stuff, fuck off.
Anyway, if someone is interested in take a look at it
<a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb" target="_blank">here</a>
is the thing.
Is not really difficult to use, but of cours if you are not aware of your own directory tree, the things will get ugly.
This entry is an update from the original one using <i>lb</i>.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for reading or whatever.
